[阿甘正传-豆瓣](https://movie.douban.com/subject/1292720/)

1. Life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get.

2. Stupid is as stupid does.

3. Miracles happen every day.

4. I don’t know if we each have a destiny, or if we’re all just floating around accidental—like on a breeze. Maybe both get happening at the same time. 

5. Death is just a part of life, something we’re all destined to do.

6. You have got to put the past behind you before you can move on.

7. If there is anything you need I will not be far away.

8. I am a man of my word.

9. There is an awful lot you can tell about a person by their shoes.

10. There is only so much fortune a man really need and the rest is just for showing off.
